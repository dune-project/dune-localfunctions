   * The main purpose of the factory class is to provide a concept for
   * caching.  Take for instance a global-valued finite element that wraps a
   * local finite element.  The local finite element will typically have very
   * few variants, and the global-valued finite element will just apply a
   * geometric transformation to the derivatives.  The wrapped local finite
   * elements can be stored inside the factory and any global-valued finite
   * elements created by the factory just contain references or pointers.
   * This way the local finite elements don't need to be created anew for each
   * global-valued finite element.
   *
   * The other purpose is to semi-standardize the interface used to actually
   * create finite elements.  "Semi" because the information needed to create
   * an actual global-valued finite element will vary between finite element
   * types.  There are however certain types of information that are needed by
   * a larger subset of all available finite elements, so it makes sense to
   * define a common encoding for these types of information.  On the other
   * hand this information is often expensive to obtain, so it makes sense to
   * only provide it when it is actually needed.
